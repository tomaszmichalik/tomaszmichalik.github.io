Museums are increasingly experimenting with innovative formats to present heritage and engage audiences. In the presentation of paintings, music can play such a role. But how can multisensory experiences enhance the engagement and aesthetic experience of museum visitors when viewing visual art? In a project led by Dr Tobiasz Trawiński from Liverpool Hope University, we tested this by asking museum visitors to view Renoir’s Dance at Bougival while listening to music from the time of the painting’s creation, as well as contemporary pieces inspired by it. Analysing gaze patterns alongside aesthetic evaluation can help us create more engaging experiences for modern museum audiences.
