abstract: Maps serve as a fundamental platform for communicating research results from experts in geophysical methods to archaeologists. But what is visible in magnetic data to recipients with different levels of knowledge? Can eye-tracking support communication between experts and archaeologists? Our study indicates that experts in magnetometry detected almost 16% more features than archaeologists, and that psychological tools may aid communication among recipients of geophysical data.
